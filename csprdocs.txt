Support
If you have any questions or run into any issues while using the CSPR.click SDKs, you can find help in the CSPR.click Developer Community. Here you can connect and get help from other developers.

Legal
By using CSPR.click, you agree to our Developer Terms of Service and acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy.


Overview
In any web application that integrates CSPR.click you'll be using the Core JS SDK. It provides the essential functionality to interact with wallets and the CSPR.click servers. Through it, you'll request a connection with a wallet to start a user session, and ask the user to sign a transaction or a message. You'll get a complete graphical interface that manages for you the interactions with the user to perform the account management and the signature requests operations.

Get your application Id
To initialize CSPR.click library, you need an appId for your application. By default, our examples use the csprclick-template identifier. You may use this value to try CSPR.click out and start developing your application.

Note, though, that this identifier is only valid for development on localhost. Before you push your application to a server, you must get your own appId on console.cspr.build.

Supported wallets
CSPR.click supports every wallet built for the Casper ecosystem.

Wallet
Provider key
Name
Casper Wallet logo

casper-wallet

Casper Wallet

Ledger logo

ledger

Ledger

WalletConnect logo

walletconnect

WalletConnect

Metamask logo

metamask-snap

Metamask (Snap)

In your application, you can decide which wallets you want to enable. To do so, set accordingly the array of providers in the CsprClickInitOptions initialization object.


Copy
const clickOptions: CsprClickInitOptions = {
    appName: 'CSPR.playground',
    appId: 'csprclick-template',
    contentMode: CONTENT_MODE.IFRAME,
    providers: [
        WALLET_KEYS.CASPER_WALLET,
        WALLET_KEYS.LEDGER,
        WALLET_KEYS.METAMASK_SNAP,
    ],
};
WalletConnect
WalletConnect is a protocol that provides a secure and convenient way for users to interact with decentralized applications. CSPR.click supports WalletConnect as a provider, allowing users to connect their WalletConnect-compatible wallets to your application.

To use WalletConnect with CSPR.click, you need to have a WalletConnect project ID. You can get one by creating a project on the WalletConnect Cloud.

Once you have your project ID, you can add it to your CSPR.click initialization options like this:


Copy
const clickOptions: CsprClickInitOptions = {
    appName: 'CSPR.playground',
    appId: 'csprclick-template',
    contentMode: CONTENT_MODE.IFRAME,
    providers: [
        WALLET_KEYS.CASPER_WALLET,
        WALLET_KEYS.LEDGER,
        WALLET_KEYS.METAMASK_SNAP,
        WALLET_KEYS.WALLET_CONNECT,
    ],
    walletConnect: {
        relayUrl: 'wss://relay.walletconnect.com',
        projectId: '6cdf3...9cc4d'
    }
};

Getting started
This page guides you through the steps to create a new React application for your project with CSPR.click UI SDK integrated and ready to use.

If you want to integrate CSPR.click JS SDK into your existing React 18 application, go to the React section. If you're not using React 19, or you don't use React in your application, you can also integrate CSPR.click following the steps described in the Javascript section.

Create a new React project
To create a new React project with CSPR.click ready to use, write the following command in a terminal session:


Copy
npx create-react-app my-casper-app --template @make-software/csprclick-react
Next, go to the newly created project directory and run the app:


Copy
cd my-casper-app
npm start
Your new app will open in your browser. If it doesn't, browse to the URL: http://localhost:3000.


Your new application
Adjust the initialization options
Your new project comes with some default initialization options. You'll need to review them and adjust some.

Open the file src/index.tsx and locate the definition of the clickOptions variable. It'll look similar to this:


Copy
import { CONTENT_MODE } from '@make-software/csprclick-core-types';

const clickOptions: CsprClickInitOptions = {
    appName: 'CSPR.app',
    appId: 'csprclick-template',
    contentMode: CONTENT_MODE.IFRAME,
    providers: [
        'casper-wallet',
        'ledger',
        'casper-signer',
    ]
};
You can use the default csprclick-template application identifier while you're working locally on your application. But to upload your new project to a server, you'll need to get your own application id.

Update the properties according to your needs. Read more about the CsprClickInitOptions type in the Core JS SDK reference.

These options are sent to CSPR.click through the <ClickProvider> component that wraps your main application component:


Copy
<ClickProvider options={clickOptions}>
  <App/>
</ClickProvider>
What's next
You're almost ready to start developing the next web3 killer app. Before you get cracking on your project, get familiar with some crucial aspects of CSPR.click that are demonstrated in the template:

Responding to CSPR.click events
The App component sets handlers to listen and respond to events triggered by CSPR.click when the user connects an account, switches to a different one, or closes the session.

Refer to the Handling events page for information on how to add your listener functions.

Customize the top navigation bar
The template displays some settings selectors in the top navigation bar. Find the ClickTopBar component in src/components/ClickTopBar/index.tsx and see how these settings are defined.

Refer to the Customizing the top bar section for complete reference on how to work with each of the setting elements in the top bar.

Request transaction approvals
At some point, your application will need to interact with the Casper network by sending a transaction (aka deploy).
CSPR.click manages this process communicating with the active wallet to request the user to approve or reject the transaction. The UI depends on the wallet.

The template includes the BuyMeACoffee components to demonstrate how to request a transaction signature and send the approved deploy to the network.

Refer to the Signing transactions page for information on how to request the user a transaction approval. Also, look at Processing status updates for information on how to listen for real-time status updates.

Leverage CSPR.cloud Proxy
CSPR.click provides a proxy to interact with the CSPR.cloud REST and Streaming APIs, as well as to set up a Node RPC client with casper-js-sdk. This is helpful when you want to interact with the CSPR.cloud APIs from the frontend of your application, as CSPR.cloud APIs require authentication and you must not expose your API keys in the frontend.

Refer to the CSPR.cloud API proxies page for information on how to use the proxy.

CSPR.click SDK
React
To create a new application with CSPR.click already integrated, we recommend you to use the create-react-app template as described in Getting started.

This page guides you through the steps required to integrate the CSPR.click SDK into your existing React web application.

Install CSPR.click packages
Run the following command in a terminal window to install CSPR.click packages:


Copy
npm install --save-dev @make-software/csprclick-ui @make-software/csprclick-core-client @make-software/csprclick-core-types
If you're using Typescript, the command above also installs type definitions for CSPR.click.

ClickProvider context provider
First, define the initialization options for the CSPR.click library:


Copy
import { CONTENT_MODE } from '@make-software/csprclick-core-types';

const clickOptions: CsprClickInitOptions = {
    appName: 'Casper dApp',
    appId: 'csprclick-template',
    contentMode: CONTENT_MODE.IFRAME,
    providers: ['casper-wallet', 'ledger', 'metamask-snap', 'casperdash'],
};
Next, wrap your main application component with the <ClickProvider> context provider:


Copy
<ClickProvider options={clickOptions}>
  <App />
</ClickProvider>
This component will manage the download and initialization of the CSPR.click runtime library.

Read more about the CsprClickInitOptions type in the SDK reference section.

You can use the default csprclick-template application identifier while you're working locally on your application. But to upload your new project to a server, you'll need to get your own application id.

Add <ClickUI> component to your app
All the CSPR.click UI elements are managed from the <ClickUI> component. This component must be added to the very beginning of your main UI component and it's responsible for displaying the top bar and all the modal windows and pop-ups needed for connecting with wallets, showing information to the user, etc.


Copy
const topBarSettings = {
    accountMenuItems: [<ViewAccountOnExplorerMenuItem key='0' />],
}

const App = () => {
    return (
        <!-- ... -->
        <ClickUI topBarSettings={topBarSettings}/>
        <!-- ... -->
    )
}
Refer to the Customizing the top bar section in this guide for complete reference on how to work with each of the setting elements in the top bar.

While we recommend to include the CSPR.click top bar in your application, if you have your own Sign in and session management controls you can opt-out. To do so, do not include the topBarSettings prop to ClickUI and CSPR.click won't render the top bar.

Add CSPR.click styles
Option 1: your application uses styled-components
When your application already uses the <ThemeProvider> component from styled-components library, you just need to add CSPR.click styles to your themes.

Considering as an example that your application has light and dark themes, you may merge the styles into your theme settings like this:


Copy
import { CsprClickThemes } from '@make-software/csprclick-ui';

const YourAppThemes = {
	dark: {
		...CsprClickThemes.dark,
		// your styles for dark theme here
	},
	light: {
		...CsprClickThemes.light,
		// your styles for light theme here
	},
};
Option 2: your application doesn't use styled-components
CSPR.click requires the styled-components library to work. Add it to your dependencies by running the command:


Copy
npm install --save styled-components@5.3.9
Next, add the theme provider to your application:


Copy
import { CsprClickThemes } from '@make-software/csprclick-ui';

<ThemeProvider theme={CsprClickThemes.light}>
  <ClickProvider options={clickOptions}>
    <App />
  </ClickProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
Currently, you can choose between two themes: light and dark.

Import required fonts
In your main CSS file, import the Inter and Jetbrains mono fonts:


Copy
@import url('https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/inter');

@font-face {
    font-family: 'JetBrains Mono';
    src: url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/web/woff2/JetBrainsMono-Regular.woff2')
        format('woff2'),
      url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/web/woff/JetBrainsMono-Regular.woff')
        format('woff');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
    font-display: swap;
  }
What's next
At this point, your application is prepared to display the CSPR.click UI to interact with the user and connect with wallets, switch to other accounts and approve transactions. Build and run your application, and take a look.

From here, your application needs to interact with CSPR.click library to, for example, respond to wallet connection and request transaction approvals. Go through the following sections as required to complete the integration:

Listen to CSPR.click events
You'll need to listen and respond to some events triggered when the user connects an account, switches to a different one, or closes the session.

Refer to the Handling events page for information on how to add your listener functions.

Ask the user to connect a wallet
If you don't display the CSPR.click top navigation bar, you must have your own Sign in or Connect buttons and respond calling the CSPR.click library .

Refer to the Connecting a wallet page for information on how to trigger the wallet connection process.

Request transaction approvals
At some point, your application will need to interact with the Casper network by sending a transaction (aka deploy).
CSPR.click manages this process communicating with the active wallet to request the user to approve or reject the transaction. The UI depends on the wallet.

Refer to the Signing transactions page for information on how to request the user a transaction approval. Also, look at Processing status updates for information on how to listen for real-time status updates.

Customize the top navigation bar
You can add any of our predefined settings selectors or account menu items. And you can define your own.

Refer to the Customizing the top bar section for complete reference on how to work with each of the setting elements in the top bar.

# Signing transactions

Applications interacting with the Casper Network must submit transactions. Every transaction requires explicit user approval, which is done by digitally signing it.

Your frontend application is not always responsible for creating the transaction. Depending on your architecture, a transaction may be constructed by your backend service, or even by a third party, before being sent to the user for approval.

Typically, you'll handle a transaction without approvals. And such approval is what you want to get from the user. Then, the transaction will be ready to be processed by a Casper node.

The CSPR.click SDK provides two ways to obtain this approval:

1. [`send()`](https://docs.cspr.click/reference/methods#send).

* Requests the active wallet to prompt the user for approval (signature).
* Automatically submits the signed transaction to a Casper node for processing.
* Optionally accepts a callback function to receive live status updates during execution (e.g., pending, confirmed, rejected).

This is the most common method. In most applications, you can simply call send() and use its result or the status updates to inform the user whether their transaction is being processed, or if it was rejected (by either the user or the network).

2. [`sign()`](https://docs.cspr.click/reference/methods#sign).

* Requests the active wallet to prompt the user for approval.
* Returns the signature value to your application, without submitting the transaction.

This method is intended for advanced scenarios, where you need the raw signature for custom workflows (e.g., off-chain processing, server-side validation, or multi-step transaction orchestration).

## Buy Alice a Coffee on testnet

In the React `create-react-app` [template ](https://docs.cspr.click/documentation/getting-started#create-a-new-project)we've added an example that shows how to request the approval for a transaction that sends to Alice (an imaginary colleague in our team) 50 CSPR testnet tokens;

<figure><img src="https://4098787943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FMwTFKCda4irtFhY9tqGt%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-e6956e436715a1649f6ad96cf72ec68e8e73df8b%2Fimage%20(6).png?alt=media" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example in the template project</p></figcaption></figure>

Take a look into the `<BuyMeACoffee>` component. Here are the key parts:

1. **Build the transaction**

First, construct a transfer transaction. Thecasper-js-sdk is included in this template to help you with this step. Refer to the official Casper SDK documentation for more detailed usage and examples.

2. **Send the transaction**

Next, call the clickRef.send() method. CSPR.click will:

* Prompt the user in the active wallet to review and sign the transaction.
* Forward the signed transaction to a Casper node for processing.

3. **Handle responses**

Your application should be prepared to handle all possible outcomes:

* Success: The transaction was sent and you receive a transaction hash.
* User rejection: The user declined to sign the transaction.
* Network rejection: The Casper node rejected the transaction.

You can handle responses using the .then() and .catch() blocks, or use the status updates as explained in the next step.

4. **(Optional) Track transaction status**

The `.send()` method accepts an optional callback function as its second argument. This callback receives transaction status updates while the transaction is being executed, enabling you to:

* Show progress indicators in your UI (e.g., “Transaction pending…”)
* Update users when the transaction is confirmed or fails
* Provide richer feedback beyond just the final outcome

```tsx
function BuyMeACoffee() {
  const clickRef = useClickRef();
  const activeAccount = clickRef?.getActiveAccount();
  const [transactionHash, setTransactionHash] = useState<string>('');
  const [waitingResponse, setWaitingResponse] = useState<boolean>(false);

  const signAndSend = (transactionObj: object, sender: string) => {
          const onStatusUpdate = (status: string, data: any) => {
            console.log('STATUS UPDATE', status, data);
            if(status === TransactionStatus.SENT)
              setWaitingResponse(true);
          };
      
          clickRef
            ?.send(transactionObj, sender, onStatusUpdate)
            .then((res: SendResult | undefined) => {
                setWaitingResponse(false);
                if (res?.transactionHash) {
                    setTransactionHash(res.transactionHash);
                    alert('Transaction sent successfully: ' + res.transactionHash +
                        '\n Status: ' +

                alert('Sign cancelled');
              } else {

# Tracking your transactions in real time

When using the `send()`method to request a transaction approval and deploy it to the network, the SDK can, optionally, establish a websocket connection with CSPR.click backend and receive real-time updates about the transaction execution.

Traditionally, applications had to rely on polling a backend service or querying a Casper node to know whether a transaction had been processed, confirmed, or rejected. This approach added complexity, increased latency, and delayed the user experience.

Using a websockets connection to listen for real-time updates, your application can:

* Receive immediate status notifications during the full transaction lifecycle.
* Update your UI with progress states (e.g., pending, processed, failed).
* Access result data without the need for extra API calls.

This makes it easier to build responsive, user-friendly applications that keep users informed in real time as their transactions move through the Casper Network.

## Receive transaction updates

To wait for transaction execution and receive status updates, pass a callback function to the `send()` method. This function will be called with status updates as the transaction is approved and processed.

```javascript
const onStatusUpdate = (status, data) => {
    console.log('STATUS UPDATE', status, data);
    if (status === TransactionStatus.SENT)
        setWaitingIndicator();
    if (status === TransactionStatus.PROCESSED)
        parseProcessedTransaction();
};

clickRef
    .send(transaction, sender, onStatusUpdate)
    .then((res) => {
        // check result and update UI accordingly
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        alert('Error: ' + err);
        throw err;
    });
```

### Status values

The `status` argument passed to the callback function can have the following values:

| Value       | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sent`      | The transaction has been signed and successfully deployed to a Casper node.                                                           |
| `processed` | The transaction has been executed by the network. May result in success or failure.                                                   |
| `expired`   | The transaction’s time-to-live (TTL) elapsed before execution.                                                                        |
| `cancelled` | The user rejected the signature request.                                                                                              |
| `timeout`   | The SDK stopped listening for updates before the transaction was finalized. A custom timeout can be specified (default: 120 seconds). |
| `error`     | An unexpected error occurred while submitting or monitoring the transaction.                                                          |
| `ping`      | A heartbeat event sent periodically to indicate that the connection is still active..                                                 |

### Data with processed Status

When the transaction reaches the processed state, the callback function receives an additional data argument.

This object contains the full `Deploy` entity, as defined in the [CSPR.cloud REST API documentation](https://docs.cspr.cloud/rest-api/deploy#properties).

Your application can use this information to:

* Show whether the transaction succeeded or failed.
* Provide more detailed feedback (e.g., execution cost, error messages).

# Customizing the top bar

{% hint style="info" %}
While we recommend to include the CSPR.click top bar in your application, if you have your own Sign in and session management controls you can opt-out. To do so, do not include the `topBarSettings` prop to `ClickUI` and CSPR.click won't render the top bar.
{% endhint %}

CSPR.click includes a navigation bar that displays on the top of the web application. It's the same navigation bar you can find on CSPR.live and other applications that integrate CSPR.click.

<figure><img src="https://4098787943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FMwTFKCda4irtFhY9tqGt%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-d5d3203cdb6fc6e805c12d4514f6e7d343f140d3%2Fcustomizing-top-bar.png?alt=media" alt=""><figcaption><p>CSPR.click navigation bar</p></figcaption></figure>

In this top bar you always see the CSPR Products menu on the left side, and the Account menu on the right side. The rest are customizable selectors that you can choose to add or not. Most of them are customizable as we'll see in the next pages.

### TopBarSettings object

This object wraps all settings in the navigation bar and is included to `<ClickUI>` as a prop. More on each configuration in the following subpages.

```tsx
const topBarSettings: TopBarSettings = {
    accountMenuItems,
    onThemeSwitch: toggleTheme,
    languageSettings: languageSettings(lang, setLang),
    currencySettings: currencySettings(currency, setCurrency),
    networkSettings: networkSettings(network, setNetwork),
};

<ClickUI
    topBarSettings={topBarSettings}
    themeMode={themeMode}
/>
```

# Hooks and Components

### Hooks

#### useClickRef() hook

In your components, you'll often need to call the CSPR.click API to get data or request an operation. To get a reference to the CSPR.click SDK instance make use of the `useClickRef()` React hook:

```tsx
import { useClickRef } from '@make-software/csprclick-ui';

function MyComponent() {
  const clickRef = useClickRef();
  ...
}
```

Then, in your application you'll be able to request CSPR.click to perform some operations using the class [methods](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/reference/methods), or get values reading the class [properties](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/reference/properties).

### Components

#### \<AccountIdenticon>

Use the `AccountIdenticon` component to display the public key identicon (or avatar). It can be used also with an account hash string.

<figure><img src="https://4098787943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FMwTFKCda4irtFhY9tqGt%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-52a85210e4d0bb931c36afa877074a93f783e757%2Faccount-identicon-example.png?alt=media" alt="AccountIdenticon component example"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In addition to the public key or account hash, indicate the size of the resulting image: `'xs'` for `16px`; `'sm'` for `20px`; `'m'` for `32px`; or `'l'` for `40px`.

```tsx
<AccountIdenticon hex={publicKey} size={'l'} />
```

The size can be indicated with a number of pixels:

```tsx
<AccountIdenticon hex={accountHash} size={40}  />
```

# JavaScript

This page guides you through the steps required to integrate the UI SDK into a non-React application.

Check also the HTML/Javascript demo in the [csprclick-examples](https://github.com/make-software/csprclick-examples) repository to see the resulting application. In that repo you can find also examples or few other libraries/frameworks.

## Download the CSPR.click UI runtime library from the CDN:

Before the closing `head` tag, add a `script` element to download the CSPR.click scripts:

```html
  <!-- update to latest released version -->
  <script defer="defer" src="https://cdn.cspr.click/ui/v1.9.0/csprclick-client-1.9.0.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Add a container for the CSPR.click UI

In your main layout file, add a `<div>` container where CSPR.click will inject some UI components like the navigation top bar or the 1-click sign in modal. Set an `id`, you'll need it later during CSPR.click initialization.

```html
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <div id="csprclick-ui"></div>
    <div id="content">
     <!-- you rapplication goes here -->
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

Also, depending on the layout of your application and the grid system you're using, you'll need to add some CSS styles to this container to match the styles of the rest of the app (width, background color, etc).

## Configure the initialization of the CSPR.click SDK

In a javascript file, add the initialization options for the CSPR.click SDK. Make sure this script loads before CSPR.click is downloaded.

The minimal configuration for the UI just defines the container for the navigation top bar and the root container of your app. We'll see other options later in this document.

```javascript
const clickUIOptions = {
  uiContainer: 'csprclick-ui', 
  rootAppElement: '#app',
  showTopBar: true,  
};
```

Next, define Client SDK options:

```javascript
const clickSDKOptions = {
  appName: 'CSPR.click demo',
  appId: 'csprclick-template',
  providers: ['casper-wallet', 'casper-signer'],
};
```

You can read more about the [CsprClickInitOptions ](https://docs.cspr.click/reference/types#csprclickinitoptions)object in the reference section.

## What's next

At this point, your application should show the CSPR.click top navigation bar and you can click on Sign in button to connect your favorite wallet.

<figure><img src="https://4098787943-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FMwTFKCda4irtFhY9tqGt%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-37c68ecaf8ab4cf34c826cfb3919511ef7151493%2Fcsprclick-integration-html.png?alt=media" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Listen to CSPR.click events

You'll need to listen and respond to some events triggered when the user connects an account, switches to a different one, or closes the session.

Refer to the [Handling events](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/handling-events) page for information on how to add your listener functions.

#### Ask the user to connect a wallet

If you don't display the CSPR.click top navigation bar, you must have your own Sign in or Connect buttons and respond calling the CSPR.click library .

Refer to the [Connecting a wallet](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/connecting-a-wallet) page for information on how to trigger the wallet connection process.

#### Request transaction approvals

At some point, your application will need to interact with the Casper network by sending a transaction (aka deploy).\
CSPR.click manages this process communicating with the active wallet to request the user to approve or reject the transaction. The UI depends on the wallet.

Refer to the [Signing transactions](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/signing-transactions) page for information on how to request the user a transaction approval. Also, look at [Processing status updates](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/processing-status-updates) for information on how to listen for real-time status updates.

#### Customize the top navigation bar

You can add any of our predefined settings selectors or account menu items. And you can define your own.

Refer to the [Customizing the top bar](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/customizing-the-top-bar) section for complete reference on how to work with each of the setting elements in the top bar.

#### Listen to CSPR.click events

You'll need to listen and respond to some events triggered when the user connects an account, switches to a different one, or closes the session.

Refer to the [Handling events](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/handling-events) page for information on how to add your listener functions.

#### Ask the user to connect a wallet

If you don't display the CSPR.click top navigation bar, you must have your own Sign in or Connect buttons and respond calling the CSPR.click library .

Refer to the [Connecting a wallet](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/connecting-a-wallet) page for information on how to trigger the wallet connection process.

#### Request transaction approvals

At some point, your application will need to interact with the Casper network by sending a transaction (aka deploy).\
CSPR.click manages this process communicating with the active wallet to request the user to approve or reject the transaction. The UI depends on the wallet.

Refer to the [Signing transactions](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/signing-transactions) page for information on how to request the user a transaction approval. Also, look at [Processing status updates](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/processing-status-updates) for information on how to listen for real-time status updates.

#### Customize the top navigation bar

You can add any of our predefined settings selectors or account menu items. And you can define your own.

Refer to the [Customizing the top bar](https://docs.cspr.click/cspr.click-sdk/javascript/customizing-the-top-bar) section for complete reference on how to work with each of the setting elements in the top bar.

# JavaScript

This page guides you through the steps required to integrate the UI SDK into a non-React application.

Check also the HTML/Javascript demo in the [csprclick-examples](https://github.com/make-software/csprclick-examples) repository to see the resulting application. In that repo you can find also examples or few other libraries/frameworks.

## Download the CSPR.click UI runtime library from the CDN:

Before the closing `head` tag, add a `script` element to download the CSPR.click scripts:

```html
  <!-- update to latest released version -->
  <script defer="defer" src="https://cdn.cspr.click/ui/v1.9.0/csprclick-client-1.9.0.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Add a container for the CSPR.click UI

In your main layout file, add a `<div>` container where CSPR.click will inject some UI components like the navigation top bar or the 1-click sign in modal. Set an `id`, you'll need it later during CSPR.click initialization.

```html
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <div id="csprclick-ui"></div>
    <div id="content">
     <!-- you rapplication goes here -->
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

Also, depending on the layout of your application and the grid system you're using, you'll need to add some CSS styles to this container to match the styles of the rest of the app (width, background color, etc).

## Configure the initialization of the CSPR.click SDK

In a javascript file, add the initialization options for the CSPR.click SDK. Make sure this script loads before CSPR.click is downloaded.

The minimal configuration for the UI just defines the container for the navigation top bar and the root container of your app. We'll see other options later in this document.

```javascript
const clickUIOptions = {
  uiContainer: 'csprclick-ui', 
  rootAppElement: '#app',
  showTopBar: true,  
};
```

Next, define Client SDK options:

```javascript
const clickSDKOptions = {
  appName: 'CSPR.click demo',
  appId: 'csprclick-template',
  providers: ['casper-wallet', 'casper-signer'],
};
```

You can read more about the [CsprClickInitOptions ](https://docs.cspr.click/reference/types#csprclickinitoptions)object in the reference section.

If your application can switch between Mainnet and Testnet networks you may want to add the network selector widget to the CSPR.click navigation bar.

## Network selector set up

Define an array with the list of networks your application supports:

```javascript
const NETWORKS = ['Mainnet', 'Testnet'];

const networkSettings = {
    networks: NETWORKS,
    currentNetwork: NETWORKS[0],
    onNetworkSwitch: (n) => {
        console.log('Network selected', n);
        window.csprclickUI.setNetwork(n);
    },
}
```

Then, add this settings object to the UI initialization defined before:

```javascript
const clickUIOptions = {
  uiContainer: 'csprclick-ui', 
  rootAppElement: '#app',
  showTopBar: true,
  networkSettings,
};
```

### Customize the network icons

You can also specify your custom icons for each of the networks:

```tsx
import mainnetIcon from './assets/ico-mainnet.svg'
import testnetIcon from './assets/ico-testnet.svg'

const NETWORKS = [
  { title: 'Mainnet', icon: mainnetIcon },
  { title: 'Testnet', icon: testnetIcon }
];
```
